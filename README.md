# CAM-LOADER
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/lbormann/cam-loader/total.svg)](https://github.com/lbormann/cam-loader/releases/latest)

cam-loader adds the missing functionality to save and restore camera-settings on windows. 
The program creates a settings file for the selected camera, which is automatically loaded upon program startup: For all cameras of the same manufacturer and model, the loaded settings file is applied.
